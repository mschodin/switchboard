Build a web app. This application is an API endpoint registry - where users can submit a form with information, and it will be stored in requests. An administrator can approve these requests. Administrators can directly add endpoints by using the same form. Use supabase for auth and database. The app's landing page is the registry. The registry is public and does not need an account to be viewed. It should be a modern looking grid with cards for each endpoint in the registry. An endpoint has: Icon, Company, Title, Description, Tags, Status, web protocol, address, ports (optional). On the UI, the cards should have a nice modern display for the following endpoint data: Icon, Company, Title, Description, Tags, Status. On the left include a sidebar that has the tags. These are Service Categories. At the top of the endpoints page there should be a search bar, this should filter on the items to show only endpoint cards that have a match. At the top of the left sidebar have my products name: "Switchboard". Bottom of the sidebar should have a button "Register Endpoint" if the user is logged in. If not authenticated put a log in button there. This endpoints page should also have a header. Simple, modern design with a header "Service Registry" and description. Right aligned to this header should be a person icon. On hover give options to login/register, etc. Use the standard auth flow. On the right, have a sidebar that is a chat box. "Chat with Switchboard" and description. The chat interface should have a text input at the bottom and a send button. The chat interface should have a list of messages. The messages should be displayed in a modern looking chat interface. The chat interface should have a header "Chat with Switchboard" and description. The chat interface should have a text input at the bottom and a send button. The chat interface should have a list of messages. The messages should be displayed in a modern looking chat interface.
